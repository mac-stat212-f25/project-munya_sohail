MOTIVATION AND INSPIRATION As potential/aspiring data scientists, we want to have a better understanding of the job market and build awareness of factors affecting salaries especially in the United States considering the current transformations and fast-changing job market.\n\n\n\nData Set\nDataset\n\n\nImplementation Plan\nDependent Variable: Salary (either as a numeric amount, or grouped categories if ranges/bands more common) Independent Variables: Job title, seniority level, location, industry, company size, company ownership, employment status Exploratory Steps: Cleaning and wrangling data Summarize salary distributions across job titles and seniority levels.​ Compare salaries by city and remote status.​ Assess influence of company size and industry.​ Use statistical modeling (e.g., regression) and visualizations to identify significant predictors. Using Confidence Intervals and ML models to explore relationships between predictors and our response variable (salary).\n\nDivision of roles :\nSohail : Data Wrangling, contribute shiny app, Stats ML contribution Munya: Sf Visualizations, Interpretations and findings, Code, Presentation",
